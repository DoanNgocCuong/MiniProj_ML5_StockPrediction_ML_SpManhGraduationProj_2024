    "- When working with time-series data such as Bitcoin prediction problem, it is recommended to set `shuffle=False` when splitting data into train-test. (This is because if `shuffle=True`, we may end up predicting past Bitcoin prices). <br>\n",
    "For other prediction problems such as house prices or car prices, it is appropriate to set `shuffle=True` (because if `shuffle=False`, for example, the house price data is sorted by price, then there is a risk of falling into the case where all houses put into the test set have higher/lower values than the average and this will result in a poor model).\n",

    "- This data is time series it's sequential, so we don't use Cross-Validation or any of the model ML techniques to evaluate error. TimeSeriesSplit, which is a specific type of cross-validation technique used for time series data. It's important to use time-series cross-validation when dealing with sequential data to avoid training on future data. TimeSeriesSplit splits the data into folds, so that the folds with data from the previous past will be used as the training set, and the future data will only be used as the test set. For example, if we split the data into 3 folds, each fold would consist of:\n",
    "    - Fold 1: Data from January 2016 to December 2017 (training set) and data from January 2018 to December 2018 (test set).    \n",
    "    - Fold 2: Data from January 2016 to December 2018 (training set) and data from January 2019 to December 2019 (test set).    \n",
    "    - Fold 3: Data from January 2016 to December 2019 (training set) and data from January 2020 to December 2020 (test set). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The code: `tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=3)` will creat a time-series cross-validation object that splits the data into 3 folds in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's convenient: to have data ORDERED IN INCREASING ORDER OF DATE(with Time-Series Data)"
